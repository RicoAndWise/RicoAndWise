- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @RicoAndWise
- ðŸ“« How to reach me? ljimenez1102@gmail.com 

As an aspiring professional with a diverse educational background and a passion for technology, I bring a unique blend of skills and experiences to the table. My journey in the tech industry began with a solid foundation in programming, particularly in Java, obtained from a technical school. This knowledge allowed me to delve into various web development projects, where I honed my skills in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and SQL, among other essentials.

Driven by a thirst for knowledge and a desire to explore new horizons, I ventured into Systems Engineering, currently advancing through my studies at the university level. Recognizing the immense potential of data science and analytics, I made a deliberate decision to pause my college journey temporarily to pursue specialized training at ITLA, a renowned technical institution in my country. It is here that I discovered my fascination with working with vast datasets, igniting a passion for the field that continues to drive my aspirations.

Currently, I am immersed in the world of software testing, exploring the realm of Quality Assurance (QA) as a potential avenue to apply my diverse skill set. Drawing from my familiarity with Agile methodologies, the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), and proficiency in SQL server and relational databases, I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to QA tasks. Moreover, my eagerness to learn and adapt is exemplified by my readiness to explore automation tools like Selenium, leveraging my programming prowess to address business needs efficiently.

I am resourceful, curious, and possess a relentless drive to excel, making me a valuable asset to any team or organization. Embracing challenges as opportunities for growth, I am committed to continuous learning and development, confident in my ability to quickly acquire new skills and knowledge as needed.
